# Flash Tasmota to your NSPanel

You need to connect to your nspanel via serial and flash tasmtoa [tasmota32-nspanel.bin](http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/release/tasmota32-nspanel.bin) to your NSPanel. 
You can use the Tasmota Web Installer to do so. [Tasmota Web Installer](https://tasmota.github.io/install/)

Checkout Blakadders Template Repo for more information on flashing, do not use the autoexec.be from this page.
[NSPanel Page of the Tasmota Template Repository](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html)

## Configure Tasmota Template for NSPanel

Configure the NSPanel template for Tasmota. (Go to Configuration and Configure Other and paste the template there, make sure to tick the activate checkbox)

![tasmota-template-config](img/tasmota-template-config.png)

You can use the following template or copy the one on the [Tasmota Template Repo Site](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html).

`{"NAME":"NSPanel","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,3872,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,225,0,480,224,1,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4736,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"ADCParam 2,11200,10000,3950 | Sleep 0 | BuzzerPWM 1"}`

After a reboot of tasmota your screen will light up with the stock display firmware.

## Upload Berry Driver to Tasmota

1. Download the autoexec.be from the repository: [Berry Driver](https://github.com/joBr99/nspanel-lovelace-ui/blob/main/tasmota/autoexec.be)

2. Go to `Consoles` > `Manage File System` in Tasmota and upload the previously downloaded file.

3. Restart your NSPanel

## Flash Firmware to Nextion Screen

Due the limitations of Berry, it's not possible to download the tft file directly from github, so I'm also renting a small server where you can download the file via HTTP.

Use the one following commands to flash the latest release from this repository, just execute the following Command in Tasmota:

EU Version: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-release.tft`

US Version Portrait: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-us-p-release.tft`

US Version Landscape: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-us-l-release.tft`

<details>
<summary>Alternatively you can use your own webserver or the one build into HomeAssistant:</summary>
<br>
Upload the nspanel.tft from the lastest release to a Webserver (for example www folder of Home Assistant) and execute the following command in Tasmota Console. (Development Version: [tft file from HMI folder](HMI/nspanel.tft))

**Webserver must be HTTP, HTTPS is not supported, due to limitations of berry lang on tasmota**

`FlashNextion http://ip-address-of-your-homeassistant:8123/local/nspanel.tft`
